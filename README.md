# I Run Code

## üìö Description

The project is supposed to provide the user with a code execution interface through telegram. while there is an official discord bot for it created by the owner of Piston API, Engineer man. there wasn't a telegram bot for it so here we are.

The bot currently supports the following languages: <br>
`Python` `C` `C++` `C#` `Bash` `Go` `Brainfuck` `Javascript` `PHP` `Rust` `Java`

> The API supports more languages and you can implement them for yourself if you use them
## ‚öôÔ∏è Setting it up

1- Create a .env file in the **app** directory and put your Telegram bot API key in the following format
`API_KEY="<your api key here>"`

2- Run the docker compose using `docker compose up -d`

## üéØ To do list

- [X] Add support for more languages
- [X] Add a loop and a return function for ease of use
- [ ] Self host the API instead of using the public instance
